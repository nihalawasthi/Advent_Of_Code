<p>
Welcome to the Advent of Code 2023 repository! This repository contains all of the AOC questions I solved in December 2023.

<h3>About Advent of Code</h3>
Advent of Code is an annual set of Christmas-themed computer programming challenges that follow an Advent calendar. It has been running since 2015. The programming puzzles cover a variety of skill sets and skill levels and can be solved using any programming language.

<h3>Goals</h3>
My goal for this repository was to solve all of the Advent of Code puzzles in December 2023. I documented my solutions in this repository, and I shared my code with others who were interested in learning more about Advent of Code.

<h3>Participation</h3>
I encourage others to participate in Advent of Code next time. It is a great way to learn new programming techniques and to challenge yourself.
